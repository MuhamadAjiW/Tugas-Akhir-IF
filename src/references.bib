  abstract  = {We present MemEC, an erasure-coding-based in-memory key-value (KV) store that achieves high availability and fast recovery while keeping low data redundancy across storage servers. MemEC is specifically designed for workloads dominated by small objects. By encoding objects in entirety, MemEC is shown to incur 60\% less storage redundancy for small objects than existing replication- and erasure-coding-based approaches. It also supports graceful transitions between decentralized requests in normal mode (i.e., no failures) and coordinated requests in degraded mode (i.e., with failures). We evaluate our MemEC prototype via testbed experiments under read-heavy and update-heavy YCSB workloads. We show that MemEC achieves high throughput and low latency in both normal and degraded modes, and supports fast transitions between the two modes.},

We describe how the priorities evolved over time as a result of hardware trends and extensive experiences running RocksDB at scale in production at a number of organizations: from optimizing write amplification, to space amplification, to CPU utilization. We describe lessons from running large-scale applications, including that resource allocation needs to be managed across different RocksDB instances, that data formats need to remain backward- and forward-compatible to allow incremental software rollouts, and that appropriate support for database replication and backups are needed. Lessons from failure handling taught us that data corruption errors needed to be detected earlier and that data integrity protection mechanisms are needed at every layer of the system. We describe improvements to the key-value interface. We describe a number of efforts that in retrospect proved to be misguided. Finally, we describe a number of open problems that could benefit from future research.},
