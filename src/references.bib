MemEC is specifically designed for workloads dominated by small objects. By encoding objects in entirety, MemEC is shown to incur 60\% less storage redundancy for small objects than existing replication- and erasure-coding-based approaches. It also supports graceful transitions between decentralized requests in normal mode (i.e., no failures) and coordinated requests in degraded mode (i.e., with failures). We evaluate our MemEC prototype via testbed experiments under read-heavy and update-heavy YCSB workloads. We show that MemEC achieves high throughput and low latency in both normal and degraded modes, and supports fast transitions between the two modes.},

We describe how the priorities evolved over time as a result of hardware trends and extensive experiences running RocksDB at scale in production at a number of organizations: from optimizing write amplification, to space amplification, to CPU utilization. We describe lessons from running large-scale applications, including that resource allocation needs to be managed across different RocksDB instances, that data formats need to remain backward- and forward-compatible to allow incremental software rollouts, and that appropriate support for database replication and backups are needed. Lessons from failure handling taught us that data corruption errors needed to be detected earlier and that data integrity protection mechanisms are needed at every layer of the system. We describe improvements to the key-value interface. We describe a number of efforts that in retrospect proved to be misguided. Finally, we describe a number of open problems that could benefit from future research.},

	abstract  = {Paxos-based state machine replication is a key technique to build highly reliable and available distributed services, such as lock servers, databases and other data storage systems. Paxos can tolerate any minority number of node crashes in an asynchronous network environment. Traditionally, Paxos is used to perform a full copy replication across all participants. However, full copy is expensive both in term of network and storage cost, especially in wide area with commodity hard drives.In this paper, we discussed the non-triviality and feasibility of combining erasure code into Paxos protocol, and presented an improved protocol named RS-Paxos (Reed Solomon Paxos). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose such a combination. Compared to Paxos, RS-Paxos requires a limitation on the number of possible failures. If the number of tolerated failures decreases by 1, RS-Paxos can save over 50\% of network transmission and disk I/O. To demonstrate the benefits of our protocol, we designed and built a key-value store based on RS-Paxos, and evaluated it on EC2 with various settings. Experiment results show that RS-Paxos achieves at most 2.5x improvement on write throughput and as much as 30\% reduction on latency, in common configurations.},

	abstract  = {Omni-Paxos is a system for state machine replication that is completely resilient to partial network partitions, a major source of service disruptions in recent years. Omni-Paxos achieves its resilience through a decoupled design that separates the execution and state of leader election from log replication. The leader election builds on the concept of quorum-connected servers, with the sole focus on connectivity. Additionally, by decoupling reconfiguration from log replication, Omni-Paxos provides flexible and parallel log migration that improves the performance and robustness of reconfiguration. Our evaluation showcases two benefits over state-of-the-art protocols: (1) guaranteed recovery in at most four election timeouts under extreme partial network partitions, and (2) up to 8x shorter reconfiguration periods with 46\% less I/O at the leader.},
